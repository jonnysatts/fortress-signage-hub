URGENT: Floor Plan Marker Placement is Broken
==============================================

PROBLEM:
The floor_plans table is missing original_width and original_height values.
Console shows: "⚠ Floor plan missing dimensions, using defaults (1920x1080)"
This breaks marker placement completely because the coordinate system is wrong.

SOLUTION:
I've created tools to fix this automatically. Follow these steps:

STEP 1: Pull latest code from GitHub
- This includes all the marker fixes and the dimension detection tools

STEP 2: Deploy the Edge Function
```
supabase functions deploy fix-floor-plan-dimensions
```

STEP 3: Run the Edge Function
Invoke the function with an empty request body {} to automatically:
- Detect all floor plans with missing dimensions
- Download each image
- Extract the real dimensions
- Update the database

OR manually check and fix:
```sql
-- Check which floor plans need fixing
SELECT id, display_name, original_width, original_height, image_url
FROM floor_plans
WHERE original_width IS NULL OR original_height IS NULL;

-- Then manually update with real dimensions:
UPDATE floor_plans
SET original_width = [actual width], original_height = [actual height]
WHERE id = '[floor-plan-id]';
```

STEP 4: Verify
```sql
SELECT id, display_name, original_width, original_height
FROM floor_plans;
```

All floor plans should now have dimensions set.
